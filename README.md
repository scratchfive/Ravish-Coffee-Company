# Ravish Coffee Company

##Introduction

The Ravish Coffee Company (RCC) codebase is built upon HTML, JavaScript and CSS with a focus on minimalist style and well integrated components. JS use is limited to a few JQuery integrations and our CSS is written in SASS using the SCSS syntax and compiled with libsass for maximum stability. All our code is meant to be simple, mixin-based and human readable as best as possible. In order to reach that goal we rely heavily upon the Bourbon framework to support our CSS output. 

##Current Status

ACTIVE

This project is undergoing active development and updates. The initial commit is a transitional codebase as we move over to SCSS and has several issues (see below). 

##Roadmap

For a list of known issues with the codebase, please refer to the issue tracker. 

Right now, our roadmap for this project consists of several short term and several long term goals. 

Short term:
- Finish the transition to SCSS and remove the CSS stylesheets entirely from the project
- Increase readability and focus on documentation...comment out all code fully 
- Move to cascading Bourbon releases and upgrade to version 5.0

Long term:
- Create affiliate tracking program
- Rework the shopping cart and checkout integration to have more complete code control 
- Create user accounts on site
- Create a more complete checkout process
