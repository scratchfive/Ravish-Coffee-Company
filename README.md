# Ravish Coffee Company

# UPDATE
#### This project has come to a permenent close and will no longer be updated. It is maintained here for archival purposes only. 

This project was last maintained in a transitional state, moving from pure CSS to an SASS based syntax. Much of this code will be broken. Copy at your own risk. 

## Introduction

The Ravish Coffee Company (RCC) codebase is built upon HTML, JavaScript and CSS with a focus on minimalist style and well integrated components. JS use is limited to a few JQuery integrations and our CSS is written in SASS using the SCSS syntax and compiled with libsass for maximum stability. All our code is meant to be simple, mixin-based and human readable as best as possible. In order to reach that goal we rely heavily upon the Bourbon framework to support our CSS output.
